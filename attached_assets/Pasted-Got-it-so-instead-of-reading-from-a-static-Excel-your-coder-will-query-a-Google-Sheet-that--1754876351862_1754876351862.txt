Got it ✅ — so instead of reading from a static Excel, your coder will **query a Google Sheet** that’s already linked to the app backend.

Here’s the **revised prompt** you can give them:

---

**Prompt for App Coder (Google Sheets version)**

> You are building a mobile/web app for tracking SAF Infantry Strength & Power (Free Weights) training.
> The master workout data is stored in a **Google Sheet** (already connected to the app).
> The Google Sheet contains these columns:
>
> * **Session** (integer 1–16) — S\&P session number
> * **Exercise** (string) — name of the exercise
> * **Sets** (integer or blank) — prescribed sets
> * **Reps** (string or blank) — prescribed reps (may be a range or “/leg”)
> * **RM** (string or blank) — repetition maximum target (e.g., “8–11 RM”)
> * **Notes** (string) — additional instructions (e.g., “6s eccentric”)
>
> **App Behaviour**:
>
> 1. The app shows a **dropdown** for the user to select the S\&P session number (1–16).
> 2. When a session is selected, the app queries the Google Sheet and **filters all rows where `Session` = selected number**.
> 3. Display the matching exercises in a table with columns:
>
>    * Exercise name
>    * Sets
>    * Reps
>    * RM
>    * Notes
> 4. Next to each exercise, have input fields for the user to log:
>
>    * **Weight lifted** (kg or “Bodyweight”)
>    * **Actual reps completed**
> 5. When the user submits, store the logged data in another connected Google Sheet (or the database) for progress tracking.
> 6. Allow the user to view past sessions and see trends in weight lifted over time.
>
> **Optimisations**:
>
> * When loading a session, **auto-fill weight fields with the last recorded value** for that exercise.
> * Support **batch entry mode** to log all exercises for the session on one page.
> * Keep Google Sheets structure consistent — new sessions or changes should not require code updates.

If you want, I can also **add a column in your Google Sheet for `Exercise Code`** (e.g., `SD` for Sumo Deadlift) so soldiers can quickly enter logs later from their notebooks instead of typing full names. That would make manual transfer super fast.

Do you want me to make that updated sheet format?
