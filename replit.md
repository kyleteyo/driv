# MSC DRIVr

## Overview

This is a Streamlit-based web application designed for military personnel to track vehicle mileage and monitor currency status. The application provides a secure, user-friendly interface for logging mileage data and ensuring compliance with military vehicle operation requirements.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
UI preferences: Clean admin interface without emojis in headers, focus on essential functions like password resets and username lookup.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Frontend**: Streamlit web interface providing an intuitive dashboard
- **Authentication**: Simple file-based authentication system with hashed passwords
- **Data Storage**: Google Sheets integration for persistent data storage
- **Business Logic**: Utility functions for currency calculations and status formatting

## Key Components

### 1. Main Application (`app.py`)
- **Purpose**: Primary entry point and UI controller
- **Technology**: Streamlit framework
- **Features**: Login/logout flow, session management, main dashboard interface
- **Architecture Decision**: Streamlit chosen for rapid development and built-in UI components

### 2. Authentication System (`auth.py`)
- **Purpose**: User authentication and credential management
- **Security**: SHA256 password hashing
- **Storage**: JSON file-based credential storage
- **Architecture Decision**: Simple file-based auth chosen for ease of deployment and minimal infrastructure requirements

### 3. Google Sheets Integration (`sheets_manager.py`)
- **Purpose**: Data persistence and synchronization
- **Technology**: Google Sheets API via gspread library
- **Authentication**: Service account credentials (JSON keyfile or environment variable)
- **Architecture Decision**: Google Sheets chosen for familiar interface, real-time collaboration, and zero database setup

### 4. Business Logic (`utils.py`)
- **Purpose**: Core business rules and calculations
- **Features**: Currency status calculation (30-day rolling period), status badge formatting
- **Architecture Decision**: Separated utility functions for better testability and reusability

## Data Flow

1. **User Authentication**: Users log in with username/password validated against hashed credentials
2. **Session Management**: Streamlit session state maintains login status
3. **Data Retrieval**: Application connects to Google Sheets to fetch mileage records
4. **Status Calculation**: System calculates currency status based on last mileage entry
5. **UI Updates**: Real-time status badges and alerts displayed to users

## External Dependencies

### Google Sheets API
- **Purpose**: Primary data storage and collaboration platform
- **Configuration**: Requires service account credentials and spreadsheet ID
- **Fallback**: Creates new spreadsheet if specified sheet not found

### Authentication Files
- **credentials.json**: User credential storage with pre-hashed passwords
- **service_account.json**: Google API service account credentials (optional, can use environment variable)

## Deployment Strategy

### Environment Variables
- `GOOGLE_SHEETS_CREDENTIALS`: JSON string containing service account credentials
- `GOOGLE_SHEET_ID`: Target spreadsheet identifier

### File Dependencies
- `credentials.json`: Contains user authentication data
- `service_account.json`: Google API credentials (fallback option)

### Deployment Considerations
- **Streamlit Cloud**: Primary deployment target with environment variable support
- **Local Development**: File-based credentials for testing
- **Security**: Credentials stored as hashed values, API keys in environment variables
- **Scalability**: Google Sheets handles concurrent access, file-based auth suitable for small teams

### User Accounts

**Admin Accounts:**
- `admin` / `password`
- `trooper1` / `secret123`
- `trooper2` / `service456`
- `commander` / `admin`

**All Personnel Accounts:**
- All 90 users from Terrex and Belrex tracker sheets have been created
- Default password for all personnel: `password123`
- Usernames match those in the Google Sheets (resolved duplicate conflicts)
- Vehicle qualifications automatically detected from spreadsheet presence
- Dual-qualified user: `cabre` (Kyle) - both Terrex and Belrex qualified

**Username Conflict Resolutions:**
- `muham` conflicts resolved: `muhda` (Muhammad Danial), `muhed` (Muhammad Edryan), `muhsh` (Muhammad Shariqie)
- `brand` conflicts resolved: `branw` (Brandon Wong), `branl` (Brandon Lim), `brans` (Brandon Soh)
- `moham` conflicts resolved: `mohfi` (Mohamed Firdani), `mohnu` (Mohammad Nur), `mohiy` (Mohamad Iyshraq)
